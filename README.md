## Overview
In this **fast-paced survival game**, seeds relentlessly chase you. Your mission is to stay alive, gather seeds safely into a *till*, and water them to grow. If you neglect watering, the seeds will shrivel up—and you’ll lose points and possibly your life.

---

## Objective
1. **Survive** as long as you can while seeds constantly spawn and chase you.  
2. **Plant Seeds** in a *till* to give them a home.  
3. **Water Seeds** before they dry out—if they do, they’re lost (and you’ll pay the price).

---

## Gameplay
- **Run!** The seeds will keep chasing you if they’re not planted.  
- **Plant** seeds by luring them over to the till (or by interacting with it, depending on your mechanics).  
- **Water** the planted seeds periodically by triggering a water action (e.g., pressing a button or collecting water power-ups).

The longer you survive and keep seeds happy, the higher your score. But watch out—the difficulty ramps up over time!

---

## Features
- **Endless Waves**: Seeds spawn in increasingly difficult waves.  
- **Unique Mechanics**: Balancing between survival (running) and maintenance (watering).  
- **Retro Graphics**: Pixel-art style reminiscent of classic arcade survivors.  
- **Score System**: Track how many seeds you successfully keep alive.

---

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone/Download** the repository to your local machine.  
2. **Open** the project in Unity (version 2020+ recommended).  
3. **Hit Play** in the Unity Editor, or build for your desired platform.

---

## Controls
- **Move** your character with the keyboard (W/A/S/D or arrow keys).  
- **Interact/Plant** seeds with `E` or by collision, depending on your setup.  
- **Water** seeds with `Spacebar` or an assigned button.

*(Feel free to customize these based on your actual in-game setup.)*
